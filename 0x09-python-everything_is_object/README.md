Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration (For answers with numbers use integers, donâ€™t spell out the word):

How many string objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (106-line1.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (106-line2.txt)
After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line3.txt)
After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line4.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (106-line5.txt)
